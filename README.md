# BRAINTEASER 
BrainTeaser is a data science project that seeks to exploit the value of big data, including those related to health, lifestyle habits, and environment, to support patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis and their clinicians. Taking advantage of cost-efficient sensors and apps, BrainTeaser will integrate large clinical datasets that host patient-generated and environmental data.
I wrote these codes in order to collect and preprocess the weather data for three involved countries, namely: Italy, Spain and Portugal
The codes consist of different sections defined as below: 
  1) Collecting big data from the E-OBS dataset, which is one of the European public datasets
  2) Calculating the closest European locations with Station Locations in the project which are near the MS patients
  3) Imputing the missing data observed in some location with K_Nearest Neighbor (KNN) imputation method with Euclidean distance
  4) Preparation of the obtained dataset for being integrated with air quality data
